# RealTime-Bus-Tracker-Exercise

<b> Description of assignment </b>
In this exercise we learned to develope an animation that shows a city bus location in real time. 

<b>How to Run:</b> 
When the index.html file is open, click the "" button and watch as the bus moves in real time on its route.

<b>Roadmap of future improvements:</b>
Because I was dealing with a wildfire at the time of this assignment I was unable to make any modifications. I plan to add some styling and use a different API to show a different bus route.
